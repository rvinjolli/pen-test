Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you all in good spirits. As we continually strive for excellence in our software development practices, I'm excited to announce Cy5150 Corp's transition to Git for version control. Given its prominence and the benefits it offers, I believe this change will significantly elevate our workflow.

To ensure everyone is on the same page, here's a categorized "Git 101" to guide you:

1. Uploading Changes:
Git Init: Initialize a new Git repository and begin tracking an existing directory with git init.

Git Add: Stage changes for commit. Use git add <filename> for specific files or git add . to stage all changes.

Git Commit: Save your staged changes along with a descriptive message using git commit -m "Your message here".

Git Push: Once you're ready, push your commits to a remote repository using git push.

2. Downloading Updates:
Git Pull: To fetch content from a remote repository and integrate it into your local directory, use git pull.

Git Fetch: This downloads content from a remote repository without merging changes into your local directory, allowing you to review updates before integrating.

3. Reviewing Changes & History:
Git Status: Check the status of your changes â€“ see what's modified, untracked, or staged.

Git Log: For a detailed history of commits, including who changed what and when.

Git Show: Dive deeper into a specific commit to see detailed changes with git show <commit_id>.

With the inclusion of Git in our processes, understanding these commands is essential. But equally vital is the grasp of Git's underlying philosophy of version control, ensuring that we maintain a clean and efficient history of our work.
